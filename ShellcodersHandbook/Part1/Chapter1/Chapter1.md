# Chapter 1: Before You Begin 

### Memory Management  
A modern computer makes no real distinction between instructions and data. This
characteristic makes system exploitation possible. 

When a program is executed, it is laid out in an organized manner. The OS
creates an address space in which the program will run (including the actual
instructions as well as any required data). The info from the executable are
loaded into the address space as follows: .text (read-only, contains actual
program text), .data (writable,contains static initialized data), .bss (writable, contains static uninitialized data). 

Finally the heap and stack are initialized. Stack grows *down* in memory address
space and is LIFO. Heap grows *up* in memory address space and is FIFO. 

### Registers 
Registers can be grouped into four categories: 
1. General purpose: used to perform a range of common mathematical operations.
   Used to store data/addresses, offset addresses, perform counting functions,
etc.
2. Segment: Used to keep track of segments.
3. Control: Used to control the function of the processor. The most important
   being to Instruction Pointer which contains the address of the next machine
instruction to be executed. 
4. Other: Extraneous registers that do not fit neatly into the first three
   categories such as EFLAGS.
