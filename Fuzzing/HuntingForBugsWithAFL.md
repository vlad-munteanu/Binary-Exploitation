# Hunting For Bugs With AFL 101 
## Fuzzing 101 
Fuzzing is a term used to describe a testing technique that is focused on
identifying anomalies within an application, through the evaluation of how the
application responds when presented with different inputs. 

**Dumb Fuzzers**: Feed target application randomly mutated input. Fast but
depend on luck. Not suitable for testing applications that verify integrity of
the content, since randomly mutated inputs will usually break the check sum. 

**Targeted Fuzzers**: Fuzzing based on fuzzing very specific parts of the
application. Ex: Peach Fuzz, Sulley. 

**Feedback driven Fuzzers**: Same as dumb fuzzers but they adjust their fuzzing
based on the output, generating families of similar types of mutated input. Ex:
AFL, honggfuzz.

## Basic AFL Concepts 
Supports programs written in C, C++, Objective C, compiled with either gcc or
clang. 

### Process of using AFL 
1. Compile a binary using AFL's compiler wrappers
2. Fuzz the binary using afl-fuzz
3. Review any unique crashes reported by afl-fuzz. Unique crashes occur if any
   of the afl-fuzz modified input files result in the target binary crashing.

### AFL Workflow 
1. Takes a testcase file as input and executes target binary. If no crash is
   detected, binary is terminated and afl proceeds to step 2.
2. Minor modifications are made to initial testcase file and binary is executed
   again with new testcase file as input. Cycle is repeated. 
3. If an input file makes program crash, afl places a copy of the testcase input
   file into /crashes directory. Cycle is repeated. 

### What is instrumentation? 
> “Instrumentation refers to an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product’s performance, to diagnose errors and to write trace information” - Wikipedia.
