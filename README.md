# Binary Exploitation
A collection of my notes, code, and various resources on binary exploitation. Making these public in hopes that it helps others along their journey of learning about binary exploitation. 

## Progress 
*This is a list of readings that I've taken notes on, in chronological order.* 

1. [Phrack Volume 7, Issue 14](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html) 
This article is from 1996 so some of the info is outdated but its a good introduction to the concepts involved in binary exploitation.
2. [CS6038/CS5138 Malware Analysis](https://class.malware.re) This is an online
   class from the University of Cincinnati. I just started it so I there's not a
lot of notes right now in the folder.
