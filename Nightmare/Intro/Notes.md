# Intro 
## Introduction to Assembly 
### Registers 
Registers are places the processor can store memory. 
**rbp**: Base pointer (points to bottom of the stack) 
**rsp**: Stack pointer (points to top of the stack) 
**rip**: Instruction pointer (pointer to the instruction to be executed) 

In x64, arguments are passed via general purpose registers: 
rdi: first argument 
rsi: second argument 
rdx: third argument
r10: fourth argument 
r8: fifth argument 
r9: sixth argument 

With x86 elf architecture, arguments are passed on the stack. (x86 is 32 bit). 

*Return Value*: In x64, return value is passed in the rax register. In x86, it
is passed in the eax register. 

**Word**: Two bytes of data. 
**Dword**: Four bytes of data. 
**Qword**: Eight bytes of data. 

### Flags 
A flag is a particular bit on a special register. If it is set or not, will
typically mean something. 

### Instructions 
#### dereference 
[] are used to dereference pointers and get the data at that address. Such as
mov rax, [rdx] will move the value pointed to by rdx into the rax register. 

#### lea
Calculates the address of the second operand and moves that address in the
first. For instance: lea rdi, [rbx+0x10] moves the address of rbx+0x10 into the
rdi.

#### push 
Grows the stack by either 8 bytes for x64, or 4 for x86, then pushes the
contents of a register onto the new stack space. 

#### pop 
Pops the top 8, or 4 (depending on architecture), bytes off of the stack and
into the argument. Then it shrinks the stack. 

### Random tidbit
ELFs store data via least endian, meaning that data is stored with the least significant byte first.

## Beginner Reversing 
### Csaw 2018 Tour of x86
Whenever you xor something by itself the result is 0
When a value is notted, the bits are flopped.
