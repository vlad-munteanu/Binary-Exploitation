# Reverse Engineering Process

### Tools and Concepts 
- Assembly Language: The core of reversing native code 
- CPU Architecture: Registers, virtual memory, etc 
- Static Analysis: IDA Pro, hex editors, and binary parsing tools 
- Dynamic Analysis: WinDbg, tracing, gdb, etc 

### Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) 
Abstract model of computer, defines what is needed to program it. 
Examples include Intel x86, Intel x86-64 (64 bit architecture), ARM and AMD 
Concepts will overlap between architectures 

**Static Analysis**: Analyzing program without execution 
**Dynamic Analysis**: Analyzing program during execution 

### Reversing Workflow 
1. Getting unknown binary file, do basic analysis such as file type, what it
   does, etc 
2. Advanced analysis, analyzing program instructions 
3. Reporting and documentation 

### Native Code Obfuscation 
Attempts to make code more difficult to analyze. 
Native code obfuscation can be difficult to detect, given enough time it is not
impossible.
